# Traffic_Sign_Predictor

In this project, I am looking at **the traffic sign dataset** from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign. The dataset contains images of many thousands traffic signs and is **labelled into 43 classes like speed limit, yield, stop etc**. The aim of this project is to **classify an image into one of the 43 classes** with some reasonable accuracy using **Convolutional Neural Networks and Keras**. 

This project utilizes **computer vision** technology to automatically detect and interpret traffic signs from images or video streams. It helps drivers by providing real time information about speed limits, stop signs and reduces the likelihood of accidents. The model performs with an **accuracy of 95% on the Test dataset**.
