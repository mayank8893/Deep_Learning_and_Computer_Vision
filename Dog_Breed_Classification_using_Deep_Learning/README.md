# Dog_Breed_Classification_using_Deep_Learning

In this project, I will try to classify a dog picture into one of the following five breeds: beagle, bernese mountain, doberman, labrador retriever and siberian husky. I will start with unzipping the file and then splitting the datset into a training and test set. Then I will visualize just one image. At this point, I will train a model  using **Convolutional Neural Networks and look at its validation accuracy**. 

I will then work on improving the model by adding more layers and by **data augmentation**. The best model performs at about **50% accuracy**. **This is beacuse it mainly mis-classifies the labrator retriever dataset beacuse they have both black and golden coat.** Finally I visualize the dog image, actual label and label predicted by the Neural networks.
