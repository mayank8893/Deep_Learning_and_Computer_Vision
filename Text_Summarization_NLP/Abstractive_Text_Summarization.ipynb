    "In this project, I will work on creating an **abstractive text summarization** from an input text using **torch and transformer model T5-small**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Text summarization is a **natural language processing (NLP)** task that involves generating concise and coherent summaries from longer pieces of text, such as articles, documents, or web pages. The goal of text summarization is to distill the main ideas, key points, and essential information from the source text while preserving its meaning and context. Summarization has various applications, including information retrieval, content summarization for news articles, automatic document summarization, and more. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Extractive summarization** methods select and extract existing sentences or phrases directly from the source text to create a summary. These selected sentences are typically the most important or representative ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Abstractive summarization** methods generate new sentences that capture the essence of the source text while using their own wording. These methods rely on natural language generation techniques and can paraphrase and combine information to create a more concise and coherent summary."
