# Age_and_Gender_Prediction

In this project, we will look at the **UTK dataset** from kaggle which has information on **age, gender and ethnicity** of about 24k images. We will use this dataset to train a deep learning model using **Convolutional Neural Networks** to do both a **classification and a regression** task.  **We will train our model to predict age and gender of any given image. The model works with about 88% accuracy on the test set.**
