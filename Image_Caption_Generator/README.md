# Image_Caption_Generator

The objective of this project is to **generate a caption for an image**. The dataset used consists of around 8000 images with 5 caption for each image. The features are extracted from both the image and the text captions for the input. The features will be concatenated to predict the next word of the caption. **CNN is used for image and LSTM is used for text. BLEU Score is used as a metric to evaluate the performance of the trained model.**
